### For Guides

#### Required

- **Clear title**: Describes what the guide covers

- **Expected output**: Show what success looks like
- **Common errors**: Address typical pitfalls
- **Version info**: Specify library/framework versions

#### Not Allowed

- **Plagiarism**: Copying without attribution

- **Illegal content**: Copyright violations, exploits, etc.
- **Deliberately wrong**: Intentionally misleading information

### For Comments

#### Helpful Comments

```markdown
Good: "Thanks for this! One note: in step 3, you might want to
add error handling for the edge case where the API returns null."

Good: "This helped me fix my issue! For anyone using TypeScript,
here's the type definition: [code]"

Good: "I think there's a typo in line 12 - should be
`const` not `cosnt`"
```

#### Unhelpful Comments

```markdown
Bad: "This doesn't work"

Bad: "Just use [other library] instead"

Bad: "Why would anyone do it this way lol"
```

## Respectful Behavior

### What Respect Looks Like

- Assuming good intent
- Disagreeing without being disagreeable
- Offering constructive criticism
- Thanking people for their contributions
- Admitting when you're wrong
- Learning from others

### What Disrespect Looks Like

- Personal attacks or insults
- Dismissive or condescending language
- Gatekeeping ("real developers don't...")
- Harassment or bullying
- Hate speech or slurs
- Doxxing or threats

<Warning>
  **Zero tolerance**: Harassment, hate speech, and threats result in immediate permanent bans.
</Warning>

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality

Your code examples should:
- **Work**: Be tested and functional
- **Be secure**: No obvious security vulnerabilities
- **Be readable**: Well-formatted and clear
- **Be appropriate**: Production-ready or labeled as example-only

### Information Accuracy

- Verify facts before publishing
- Cite sources when applicable
- Specify versions and dependencies
- Note if information may become outdated
- Update guides when needed

### Intellectual Property

- **Original work**: Write your own guides
- **Proper attribution**: Credit sources and inspirations
- **Respect licenses**: Follow open source licenses
- **No plagiarism**: Don't copy without permission

## SFW vs NSFW Content

### SFW Mode (Safe for Work)

- Professional language
- No profanity
- No mature content
- Appropriate for all audiences

### NSFW Mode (Not Safe for Work)

- Casual language allowed
- Mild profanity permitted
- Still no explicit content
- Still professional in tone

<Info>
  **The line**: NSFW doesn't mean "anything goes". It means slightly more relaxed language, not inappropriate content.
</Info>
