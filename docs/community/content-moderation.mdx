## Our Approach

RTFM.guide uses a balanced approach to moderation:
- **Automated first-line defense**: Spam prevention and basic filtering
- **Community reporting**: Users flag problematic content
- **Manual review**: Human moderators make final decisions
- **Transparent**: Clear guidelines and appeal process

## What Gets Moderated?

### Comments

All comments are subject to moderation:

**First-Time Commenters**
- First comment from each user is held for review
- Typically reviewed within 24 hours
- Once approved, future comments post immediately
- Auto-approval after first successful comment

**Subsequent Comments**
- Posted immediately
- Subject to community reports
- Reviewed if flagged

### Guides

Guides are generally not pre-moderated, but can be:
- Reported by users
- Reviewed if flagged
- Removed if violating guidelines
- Author notified of actions taken
