### Abuse of Reporting

False or malicious reports are taken seriously:

## Privacy

</Info>

However:
- Moderators can see who submitted reports
- Your identity may be revealed in legal situations
- Obvious from context in small discussions

## After Reporting

### What You Should Do

- **Continue browsing**: Don't engage further with the content
- **Don't mention it**: Avoid discussing the report publicly
- **Be patient**: Allow time for review (typically 24 hours)
- **Don't report again**: One report is enough

### What You Shouldn't Do

- **Don't engage**: Don't respond to or provoke the user
- **Don't retaliate**: Don't harass the user
- **Don't spam**: Don't submit multiple reports
- **Don't publicize**: Don't share that you reported

## If You're Reported

1. **Stay calm**: Reports happen, even incorrectly

5. **Appeal if appropriate**: Use proper channels
