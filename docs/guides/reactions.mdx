## What Are Reactions?

Reactions let you show appreciation for guides without writing a comment. They help authors understand how their content is being received and help other users find the most valuable guides.

## Available Reactions

| Reaction | Name | When to Use |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 👍 | **Helpful** | This guide answered my question or solved my problem |
| 💾 | **Saved Me** | This guide saved me significant time (hours or more) |
| ⏰ | **Outdated** | This information is no longer accurate or current |

## How to React

1. Open any guide
2. Scroll to the reactions section (usually near the top)
3. Click a reaction button to add your reaction
4. Click again to remove your reaction

<Info>
  You must be logged in to react to guides.

## Reaction Rules

## What Reactions Mean

### Helpful (👍)

Use this when a guide:
- Answered your specific question
- Solved a problem you were facing
- Provided clear, working instructions
- Was well-written and easy to follow

### Saved Me (💾)

Reserve this for guides that:
- Prevented hours of debugging or research
- Provided a solution you couldn't find elsewhere
- Saved a critical deadline
- Showed you something you'd never have discovered alone

<Tip>
  **Be selective with "Saved Me"**: This reaction is meant to highlight exceptionally valuable guides. Use it sparingly to maintain its significance.
</Tip>

### Outdated (⏰)

Use this when:
- Code examples no longer work
- Library versions have changed significantly
- Best practices have evolved
- Links are broken or resources removed
