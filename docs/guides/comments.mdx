## Comment Etiquette

I'm using Node 20 and npm 10. Any suggestions?
```

Bad question format:
```
doesn't work help!!!
```

### Providing Feedback

Good feedback:
```
Great guide! One suggestion: on line 15, you could use
const instead of let since the variable isn't reassigned.
```

Bad feedback:
```
This is wrong. You don't know what you're doing.
```

Good issue report:
```
